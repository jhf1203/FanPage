        <h2>Style</h2>

        <blockquote>
            <p> literate rock that presents at first as artily sombre, and eventually as one of the most nuanced 21st-century iterations of what used to be known as “college rock”.</p> </blockquote>
            <footer> Kitty Empire, <cite>The Guardian</cite></footer>
<br />
            The National has been compared to Joy Division, Leonard Cohen, Interpol, Wilco, Depeche Mode and Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds. The band's lyrics have been described as "dark, melancholy and difficult to interpret."
        
        They have released 8 studio albums in the last 20 years</p>

        <h2>Personal</h2>

        <p>The National has followed me through adulthood, and I always find relevance to my own life in Matt's lyrics and an atmosphere from the band's instrumentation that can serve as a soundtrack for my life in any situation.  From my first listen of "Mr. November" in college to relaxing with a glass of whiskey last night with "Dark Side Of the Gym" in my headphones, The National has been there with me throughout my 20s and 30s and will remain a staple that I hope to share with my son in the future.  With that I will leave you with my favorite National track.</p>
